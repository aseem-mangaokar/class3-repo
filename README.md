I am Aseem Mangaokar.
I was born in India, and lived in Singapore and Indonesia before relocating to Los Angeles for undergraduate studies in Economics.
I have dedicated myself to a career in music production and performance, and now look to the ways in which I can apply my understanding of FinTech to improve the conditions under which freelancers and creatives of all types perform.
I chose fintech as a career path due to the combination of my lifelong interest in finance and my chosen career path as a professional music producer. Since finance and technology have been so intertwined throughout my career, I thought it only right to pursue an understanding of how they can work better together.
